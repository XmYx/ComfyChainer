    "3D cartoon character host, consistent design: friendly teal robot with round head, big expressive eyes, small antenna, orange hoodie, name tag 'Q', speaking directly to camera with clear mouth animation and hand gestures, walking through a stylized neon lab, constant camera motion (slow dolly-in), environment interaction: taps a floating hologram, spoken dialogue: 'Welcome! Today we explore quantum physics—where particles behave like waves.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host 'Q', continuous motion (side-tracking shot), points at two glowing doors labeled 'Wave' and 'Particle', environment interaction: pushes both doors slightly and they shimmer, spoken dialogue: 'This is wave–particle duality. Light can act like a ripple… or like a tiny ping-pong ball.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, camera orbiting slowly around them, holds a cartoon flashlight that projects a wave pattern onto the floor, interaction: wave pattern morphs into bouncing dots, spoken dialogue: 'The measurement you choose changes what you see. That’s not magic—it's how quantum experiments work.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, forward walking shot, approaches a big cartoon double-slit wall, interaction: tosses sparkling marbles through two slits and a wavey interference pattern appears on a screen, spoken dialogue: 'The double-slit experiment shows interference—until we measure which slit the particle took.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, constant smooth crane-down shot, waves a handheld 'detector' and the interference pattern collapses into two blobs, interaction: presses a button and the screen flickers, spoken dialogue: 'When we measure “which path,” the interference disappears. Observation changes the outcome.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, slow dolly-out, opens a lunchbox labeled 'Superposition', inside are two glowing coins spinning, interaction: gently closes the lid and the coins snap into heads or tails, spoken dialogue: 'Superposition means a system can be in multiple states—until measurement forces a single result.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, walking across a stylized forest of giant atoms (tree trunks shaped like nuclei, leaves like electron clouds), constant motion (handheld-like but smooth), interaction: brushes a leaf and it emits a probability cloud sparkle, spoken dialogue: 'Instead of certainty, quantum physics gives probabilities—like a map of where outcomes are likely.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, slow push-in, holds two linked glowing spheres labeled 'A' and 'B', interaction: spins one sphere and the other reacts instantly with synchronized glow, spoken dialogue: 'Entanglement links particles so their properties match—no matter how far apart they are.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, gentle orbit shot, draws a chalk line on the ground that becomes a glowing “quantum circuit,” interaction: steps on nodes and gates light up, spoken dialogue: 'Quantum computers use qubits—units that can be 0 and 1 at once—plus entanglement to process information.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, constant forward motion through a rain of floating numbers and wave symbols, interaction: catches a symbol and it turns into a musical note, spoken dialogue: 'Think of amplitudes like complex waves. They can add, cancel, and shape the probability of outcomes.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, low-angle dolly, stands beside a cartoon cat-shaped box, interaction: peeks inside and a happy cat hologram appears then disappears, spoken dialogue: 'Schrödinger’s cat is a thought experiment about superposition—not a recipe for spooky pets.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, slow tracking shot, pulls out a magnifying glass that zooms into a tiny electron orbiting as a cloud, interaction: the cloud jitters when watched, spoken dialogue: 'Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle says some pairs of properties—like position and momentum—can’t both be perfectly known.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, smooth crane-up, tosses a glowing dice that splits into many faint dice mid-air, interaction: snaps fingers and they merge into one result, spoken dialogue: 'Quantum outcomes aren’t predetermined like classical dice. Nature gives a range of possibilities.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, continuous motion through a stylized city where streetlights flicker as wavefunctions, interaction: waves hand and the lights synchronize, spoken dialogue: 'Quantum field theory describes particles as excitations in fields—like tiny vibrations in the fabric of reality.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, slow dolly-in to a calm close-up, warm studio lighting, subtle background motion, interaction: holds a small glowing qubit and it spins between 0 and 1 icons, spoken dialogue: 'If you remember one thing: quantum physics is about waves of probability—and measurement turns possibilities into facts.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, camera orbit, points to a floating title card 'Next: Quantum Tunneling', interaction: steps through a cartoon wall and pops out the other side, spoken dialogue: 'Next time we’ll talk about tunneling—how particles sometimes pass through barriers they shouldn’t, classically.'",
    "3D cartoon robot host, gentle dolly-out, waves goodbye with friendly smile, background lab dims into soft neon, interaction: switches off a hologram, spoken dialogue: 'Thanks for watching. Stay curious—and keep questioning reality, one qubit at a time!'"
